# Contributing to pg_saga

First and foremost, thank you! We appreciate that you want to contribute to `pg_saga`, and we value your input. Here are a few guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting Started

- **Forking and Cloning**: Start by forking the `pg_saga` repository and then clone it to your local machine. This will give you a sandboxed environment to make and test your changes.

- **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch from `main` (or the current default branch) for your changes. This keeps the history clean and your changes isolated.

## Making Changes

- **Coding Standards**: Please ensure your code adheres to standard coding conventions. This often makes the code more readable and reduces the chance of errors.

- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages. A good rule of thumb is that someone should be able to understand the major points of your change solely by reading the commit message.

- **Testing**: Add tests for your changes, especially if it introduces new functionality. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Pull Requests

- **Small Changes**: Smaller changes can be crafted and submitted directly as a PR. For larger changes, please discuss them first in an issue.

- **Descriptive Titles**: Ensure your PR has a descriptive title that can give an idea about the changes, e.g., "Added support for X functionality" or "Fixed bug when doing Y".

- **Review**: Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review your proposed changes. They might suggest changes, improvements, or provide feedback.
